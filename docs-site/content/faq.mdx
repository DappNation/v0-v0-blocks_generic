# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is ETHBLOX?

ETHBLOX is an on-chain voxel building protocol where users create 3D structures in a browser-based editor and mint them as NFTs on Ethereum. Each build is scored using a Builder Weight (BW) system that rewards creativity and complexity.

### Is ETHBLOX free to use?

The builder interface is free to use. Saving builds requires a wallet connection but no fees. Minting builds as NFTs will require:
- BLOX tokens (for build costs)
- ETH (for gas fees)
- Mould licenses (one-time BLOX payment)

### What blockchain does ETHBLOX use?

ETHBLOX will launch on Ethereum mainnet. We're currently in testnet/MVP phase.

## Building

### How do I start building?

1. Go to `/build` in the app
2. Use the toolbar to select colors and block dimensions
3. Click on the platform to place blocks
4. Stack blocks by clicking on existing blocks
5. Save your creation (requires wallet connection)

### What are the build limits?

- **Platform size**: 20×20 grid
- **Block dimensions**: 1-20 units (width/depth)
- **Height**: No limit (stack infinitely)
- **Block count**: No enforced limit (performance may degrade with 1000+ blocks)

### Can I rotate blocks?

Not yet. All blocks are currently axis-aligned cubes. Rotation features are planned for future updates.

### How do I change block colors?

Use the color palette in the left sidebar or press number keys 1-8. You can switch between 3 color themes: Default, Muted, and Monochrome.

### What keyboard shortcuts are available?

\`\`\`
Cmd/Ctrl + S     Save build
Cmd/Ctrl + O     Load build
Cmd/Ctrl + Z     Undo
Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Z Redo
1-8              Select color
W/S              Adjust width
A/D              Adjust depth
C                Clear all
Space            Toggle auto-rotate
B/M/E            Build/Move/Erase mode
T                Cycle color themes
\`\`\`

## Wallet & Accounts

### Why do I need to connect a wallet?

Wallet connection enables:
- Saving builds to your personal cloud storage
- Accessing "My Builds" gallery
- Future: Minting NFTs and earning rewards

### Can I use the builder without a wallet?

Yes, but builds will only save to your browser's localStorage (temporary). Connect a wallet to save permanently and access builds from any device.

### Which wallets are supported?

Currently MetaMask only. Support for WalletConnect and other providers coming soon.

### How do I switch wallets?

Click your connected address in the header, then click "Switch Account" in the drawer. This will prompt MetaMask's account selector.

---

## Saving & Loading

### Where are my builds stored?

- **Temporary**: Browser localStorage (no wallet required)
- **Permanent**: Vercel KV (Redis) cloud storage (wallet required)
- **On-chain**: After minting as NFT (future feature)

### Can other people see my builds?

Only builds you explicitly publish to the gallery are visible to others. All saved builds in "My Builds" are private by default.

### How many builds can I save?

Currently no limit. Production deployment may enforce limits based on storage costs.

### Can I export my builds?

Not yet. Export to JSON, OBJ, and GLTF formats planned for future updates.

## Economics & Rewards

### What is Builder Weight (BW)?

BW is a score that measures build complexity using the formula:

\`\`\`
BW = log(1 + mass) × log(2 + uniqueColors)
\`\`\`

Higher BW means more creative/complex builds, which earn higher rewards from the weekly pool.

### How do I earn BLOX tokens?

After mainnet launch:
1. Build and mint NFTs with high BW scores
2. Stake BLOX in the protocol
3. Participate in community challenges
4. Trade builds on secondary markets

### What are moulds?

Moulds are licensed block shapes you can use in your builds. In the MVP, only rectangular blocks (1×1, 1×2, 2×2, etc.) are available. Future updates will add complex shapes like arches, curves, and custom geometries.

### How much does it cost to mint a build?

Cost formula (to be finalized):
\`\`\`
Build Cost = base_cost × log(1 + mass)
\`\`\`

Plus Ethereum gas fees. Exact pricing TBD before mainnet.

## Technical

### What technology is ETHBLOX built with?

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + React 19
- **3D Engine**: Three.js + React Three Fiber
- **Database**: Vercel KV (Redis)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (in development)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

### Can I run ETHBLOX locally?

Yes! Clone the repo, install dependencies, and run:
\`\`\`bash
npm install
npm run dev
\`\`\`

See the [Overview](/docs/overview) page for detailed setup instructions.

### Is the code open source?

The MVP codebase is currently private. Open sourcing planned after security audits and mainnet launch.

### How do I report bugs?

Open an issue on our GitHub repo or reach out on Discord (links coming soon).
