# Overview

Welcome to the ETHBLOX documentation. ETHBLOX is an on-chain voxel building protocol that enables users to create, own, and trade 3D digital structures as NFTs on Ethereum.

## What is ETHBLOX?

ETHBLOX is a decentralized platform where creativity meets blockchain technology. Build intricate 3D voxel structures in a browser-based editor, save them to the cloud, and mint them as ERC-721 NFTs with verifiable on-chain metadata.

## Key Features

- **Browser-Based 3D Builder** - Intuitive Three.js editor with real-time rendering
- **Wallet Integration** - MetaMask connection for user authentication and NFT ownership
- **Cloud Storage** - Save and load builds with Vercel KV (Redis)
- **On-Chain Ready** - Metadata prepared for ERC-721/1155 standards
- **Builder Weight System** - Complexity scoring based on mass and color diversity
- **Modular Architecture** - Clean separation between geometry, rendering, and storage

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+**
- **npm / pnpm / yarn** (choose one)
- **Git**
- **MetaMask** browser extension (for wallet features)

### Quick Start

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

\`\`\`bash
git clone <your-ethblox-repo-url> ethblox
cd ethblox
npm install
npm run dev
\`\`\`

The builder will be available at `http://localhost:3000/build`

### Environment Variables

Required for full functionality:

\`\`\`bash
# Vercel KV (Redis) - for save/load features
KV_URL=your_kv_url
KV_REST_API_URL=your_api_url
KV_REST_API_TOKEN=your_token

# Optional: WalletConnect Project ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
\`\`\`

<Callout variant="info">
You can run the builder locally without Redis - builds will save to localStorage only.
</Callout>

## Architecture

ETHBLOX consists of three main layers:

1. **Frontend** - Next.js 15 App Router with React 19
2. **3D Engine** - Three.js + React Three Fiber for voxel rendering
3. **Backend** - Server actions + Vercel KV for data persistence

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **3D Rendering**: Three.js (0.169), React Three Fiber, @react-three/drei
- **State Management**: React hooks (no Zustand/Redux)
- **Database**: Vercel KV (Redis)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Radix UI + shadcn/ui
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout
