# Protocol

## Architecture Overview

The ETHBLOX protocol consists of several interconnected smart contracts that manage mould licensing, BLOX tokens, build validation, and NFT minting.

## Core Components

### BLOX Token (ERC-20)

The native utility token used for:
- Licensing moulds
- Paying build costs
- Staking for rewards
- Governance (future)

### Mould Registry

Manages the library of licensed building block shapes. Each mould has:
- Unique geometry definition
- License cost in BLOX
- Rarity tier
- Interoperability constraints

### Build Validator

On-chain logic that validates:
- Structural integrity
- Mould usage compliance
- Mass limits per tier
- Color assignments

### Build NFT (ERC-721)

Each completed build becomes a unique NFT with:
- On-chain metadata
- IPFS geometry reference
- Builder Weight (BW) score
- Provenance history
