## How to Build and Earn

### Step 1: Acquire BLOX

Purchase BLOX tokens from:
- Uniswap
- Centralized exchanges (post-launch)
- Earning through participation

### Step 2: License Moulds

Choose moulds based on:
- Your creative vision
- License cost
- Rarity tier
- Interoperability needs

Each mould license is permanent (one-time cost).

### Step 3: Build

Use the web-based 3D editor:
- Place blocks in 3D space
- Assign colors from palette
- Stack and compose structures
- Preview before minting

### Step 4: Mint as NFT

Pay the build cost and mint:
- Gas fees (Ethereum)
- BLOX build cost (variable)
- Receive ERC-721 NFT
- Earn Builder Weight score

### Step 5: Earn Rewards

Builds with higher BW earn more from the weekly rewards pool:

\`\`\`
Your Reward = (Your BW / Total BW) × Weekly Pool
\`\`\`

## Build Strategies

### Maximize BW

- Use more unique colors
- Increase build mass (block count)
- Balance cost vs. reward potential

### Optimize Costs

- Stick to common moulds
- Minimize mass for low-cost builds
- Build in batches to save gas

### Collaborate

- Remix existing builds (if enabled)
- Participate in community challenges
- Join builder guilds (future)
