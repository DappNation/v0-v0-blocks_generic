### Build Costs

Each BLOX unit in a build has a marginal cost:
- Cost = base_cost × log(1 + mass)

### Staking

Stake BLOX to earn:
- Protocol fees (70% to stakers)
- Builder rewards based on BW
- Governance rights (future)

## Builder Weight (BW)

BW determines reward distribution:

\`\`\`
BW = log(1 + mass) × log(2 + uniqueColors)
\`\`\`

Higher BW = Higher share of weekly rewards pool.
